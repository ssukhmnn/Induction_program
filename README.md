##**DAY1** (31.07.2025)
At First I reached the college around 8:30 AM and headed straight to the Gurdwara Sahib inside the campus the gurdwara  has a simple and peaceful design, it has a white dome at the center,with white clean walls on that day the color of Nishan sahib was Dark Blue. The calm atmosphere and sound of SHRI JAPJI SAHIB  created a peaceful start to the day. After JAPJI SAHIB the ragi jatha started with "Dolan te rakho prabhu Nanak deh kar hath...." this created a postivity, and then the first shabad begins ragi Singh started with Shabad *Waheguru* in Kehrwa tal so that sangat can start concentrating. shabad resited by him were- "Satgur Hoye Dyal"," Kar Kirpa Tere Gun Gawan","Apni Bhagti Laye...." and more. It was a great begining of day!  
At 10:30 AM I went to the Auditorium, seniors welcomed everyone in a floral way.
