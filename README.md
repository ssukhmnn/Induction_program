##  **Day 1**

I reached the college around **8:30 AM** and went straight to the *Gurdwara Sahib* inside the campus. The design of the Gurdwara was simple and peaceful. The calm atmosphere and the sound of **Shri Japji Sahib** gave a very positive and spiritual start to the day.

After Japji Sahib, the *Ragi Jatha* began with “**Dolan te rakho prabhu Nanak deh kar hath**...” — this created a beautiful spiritual vibe. The first shabad started with *Waheguru* in **Kehrwa Taal**, helping the *sangat* focus their minds. The shabads included:
- *Satgur Hoye Dyal*
- *Kar Kirpa Tere Gun Gawan*
- *Apni Bhagti Laye...*

It was a divine and energetic start to the day!

###  **Speaker 1: Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi**
He gave us a brief about the college infrastructure, research labs, student clubs, and various facilities. He proudly told us that **GNDEC has been contributing to quality technical education since 1956**, and that **70% seats are reserved for rural students**.

###  **Speaker 2: Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal**

She delivered a motivating session where she compared student life to a **"continuous function"** — always growing and evolving. She used a creative video showing the graph of *growth vs. letter ‘P’*, where P stood for:  
`Pressure, Patience, Persistence, Perseverance, and Placement`  
As the size of 'P' increased, so did growth, symbolizing progress towards our goals. Her words encouraged us to trust our teachers, work hard, and stay spiritually grounded.

He emphasized the importance of **communication skills, leadership, teamwork**, and consistency. He advised us to be curious, interact with teachers and seniors, and stay active in both technical and extracurricular activities. He reminded us that engineering is not just about solving equations — it's about real-world skills and continuous learning.

###  **Speaker 4: Dr. Parminder Singh**  
He gave the inspiring example of *Shaheed Pooran Singh*, explaining that **dedication can defeat all difficulties**. He told us to always respect our parents and remember:  
> *“There can be a substitute for intelligence, but never for hard work.”*  
He ended with a powerful message — *these 4 years will shape our entire future*.

###  **Speaker 5: Dr. Sehajpal Singh (Principal)**  
He highlighted how **Computer Science and IT** are deeply connected with daily life now. He spoke about **AI's role in society** and explained how we must **polish our skills to a pro level** to stay ahead. He encouraged us to:
- Believe in ourselves
- Stay honest and humble

His words reflected deep vision and a clear roadmap for our growth.

###  **Speaker 6: Mr. Ravinder Garg**

> *“If you stay consistent at GNDEC, you will definitely build a bright future.”*

###  **Speaker 8: Mr. Ashok Singla (Financial Advisor)**  
He gave a helpful session on **educational loans** — explaining:
- Step-by-step process to apply

- Interest rates and government schemes  
His session was very practical and helped us understand how to manage finances during our course.

###  **Speaker 9: Mr. Rakesh Kumar** *(Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana & 1991 Batch Alumnus)*  
He shared his college memories, real-life challenges, and lessons. His speech was filled with pride and inspiration. His words encouraged us to stay focused and make the most of this golden time.

After the sessions, around **1:00 PM**, we had a lunch break. Then, from **1:30 PM to 2:00 PM**, the **NCC candidates** came and introduced themselves and the unit.

Later, we were taken for a **department visit**, where our faculty members welcomed us and introduced us to the college and our respective departments. It was a great opportunity to explore our new academic environment.
