##  **Day 1**

I reached the college around **8:30 AM** and went straight to the *Gurdwara Sahib* inside the campus. The design of the Gurdwara was simple and peaceful. The calm atmosphere and the sound of **Shri Japji Sahib** gave a very positive and spiritual start to the day.

After Japji Sahib, the *Ragi Jatha* began with “**Dolan te rakho prabhu Nanak deh kar hath**...” — this created a beautiful spiritual vibe. The first shabad started with *Waheguru* in **Kehrwa Taal**, helping the *sangat* focus their minds. The shabads included:
- *Satgur Hoye Dyal*
- *Kar Kirpa Tere Gun Gawan*
- *Apni Bhagti Laye...*

It was a divine and energetic start to the day!

`Pressure, Patience, Persistence, Perseverance, and Placement`  
As the size of 'P' increased, so did growth, symbolizing progress towards our goals. Her words encouraged us to trust our teachers, work hard, and stay spiritually grounded.

###  **Speaker 3: Dr. Akshay**  
He emphasized the importance of **communication skills, leadership, teamwork**, and consistency.

###  **Speaker 4: Dr. Parminder Singh**  
He gave the inspiring example of *Shaheed Pooran Singh*, explaining that **dedication can defeat all difficulties**. He told us to always respect our parents and remember:  
> *“There can be a substitute for intelligence, but never for hard work.”*  
He ended with a powerful message — *these 4 years will shape our entire future*.

###  **Speaker 5: Dr. Sehajpal Singh (Principal)**  
He highlighted how **Computer Science and IT** are deeply connected with daily life now. He spoke about **AI's role in society** and explained how we must **polish our skills to a pro level** to stay ahead. He encouraged us to:
- Believe in ourselves

### **Summary – Day 1**

Overall, Day 1 of the induction program was full of inspiration, positivity, and useful information. Hearing from so many experienced and motivating speakers helped us feel more connected and confident about starting our journey at GNDEC. From spiritual beginnings to practical insights — it was a powerful and memorable start to our college life.


##  Day 2

###  Expert Lecture by Dr. Arashdeep Singh )
We attended an insightful lecture by Dr. Arashdeep Singh in the auditorium. The topic was **“Food: A Pivotal Role in Student's Overall Wellness.”**  
He discussed the importance of balanced nutrition, hydration, and healthy food habits for mental focus and physical energy, especially for students managing busy schedules which would also help us to maintain our mental and physical health.

###  Session by Causmic Club & Induction Launch 
The **Causmic Club** hosted an engaging session that officially launched the **Induction Activities**. They introduced us to various creative opportunities and encouraged us to participate in technical and cultural events throughout the program.

###  GitHub Tutorial 
A hands-on session was conducted where we were guided through the process of:
- Creating a GitHub account  
- Setting up our first repository  
- Understanding basic version control concepts  
This session helped many of us take our first step into open-source and code portfolio building.

## Day 3

## Expert Lecture by Dr.Jaswinder Singh (Incharger-IAPT)

The day started with a deeply engaging session in the auditorium. The speaker began by asking all students to close their eyes and try to look within themselves. His motive was to help us experience inner stillness and calmness. After the silence, he asked what we saw or felt. One student said their mind wasn’t still, another visualized Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Some students saw their future success, one imagined being in space, another said she saw Shiv Ji. One student said his focus remained entirely on the center of his head. 

The speaker linked these experiences with science and also brought in references from Gurbani, including a line from Japji Sahib: “Kita pasao eko kawaao, tis te hoye lakh dariyaao,” which he explained in depth. He spoke about vibrations and how clapping generates vibrations that can remove bacteria from our hands. He introduced new ways of meditation and shared various personal experiments he had done to better understand the self.

He also talked about his own journey — how he developed his speaking skills over time. Every time he was called to speak on a stage like this, he treated it as a test and gave his best. Over the years, he said, he learned a lot and enjoyed every moment of it. He thanked the GNDEC staff for their support and told us first-year students that we are lucky to be learning under such good teachers.

Toward the end of his session, he shared a story that left a strong impact. A girl once went for a job interview. When asked her father’s name, she replied honestly. The interviewer stood up and said, “You’re selected.” Inside, she felt proud and said to herself, “Papa, you are great. I didn’t understand you before, but now I do.” This story tied together his message of honesty, self-awareness, and the silent strength that comes from those who support us.

## Exprert Lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Madam on "Universal Human Values"

After a short period, the second expert lecture was delivered by another speaker on the topic of Universal Human Values. The session focused on developing awareness of our responsibilities as individuals and understanding the role of values in everyday life. The speaker explained how respect, empathy, and trust help shape not just our professional lives but also the kind of person we become. The tone of the session was calm and thoughtful, and it encouraged us to reflect more deeply on how we act and how we treat people around us.


## Day 4

At 12:30, we had an expert lecture by Priya Darshini Madam on “Universal Human Values – 2.” She picked up from where she had left on Day 3 and went deeper into the idea of Right Understanding. She began by making us see the difference between what animals need and what humans need. Animals have only one requirement — physical facilities like food, shelter, and safety. But human beings, apart from physical facilities, also need the right understanding in order to live happily.

She explained that just having physical needs fulfilled is necessary but not adequate. A person might have all comforts and still be unhappy if there’s no harmony in relationships, no clarity in thoughts, and no right understanding. On the other hand, even with limited resources, if there is understanding and mutual respect, life can still feel rich and fulfilling. She pointed out that when we lack right understanding, it leads to unhappiness — not just for us, but for people around us. Sometimes we even cause hurt to others without meaning to, simply because our thoughts and values aren’t clear.

At one point, she paused and asked us to honestly think about our daily lives — “How much time do you give to yourself for self-reflection, for understanding your relationships, for nurturing harmony?” Most of us realized that our schedules are filled with tasks, assignments, and studies, but very little time goes into understanding ourselves or working on our values. That’s when she reminded us that true growth isn’t just about grades or achievements — it’s also about building inner clarity, empathy, and respect for others.

The way she spoke was simple but very impactful. It wasn’t just theory — she connected it to situations we could actually relate to in our day-to-day life. By the end of the lecture, it felt less like a classroom session and more like a conversation we needed to have with ourselves for a long time.

Then, from 3 to 4 pm, it was the Causmic Club session. They started by introducing themselves and the purpose of the club. The name itself — Causmic — came from their idea of blending “cause” with the vastness of the “cosmos,” meaning they aim to explore big ideas, solve real problems, and push creative boundaries.

They told us about the different events they have organized over time — GNE’s ACME, GNE’s APEX, Genconian Craft Prix, Bachelor Buddies, and Ambit Youth Parliament. Each one had its own vibe — some were technical, some were creative, and some were about open discussions and debates. What stood out was that the club is not restricted to one department or year — it’s open to anyone who wants to learn, share, and contribute.

They also spoke about how being part of the club is not just about attending events but actually getting hands-on experience — working in teams, taking up leadership roles, learning to handle challenges, and making ideas come to life. The energy they brought into the room made the whole session feel like more than just a formality. By the end, many of us were already thinking about how we could be a part of it.

## Day 6 – Induction Program Experience

The day started with **Sardar Gurcharan Singh Grewal**, member of SGPC, who greeted everyone warmly with a “Fateh” and told us that this wouldn’t be a lecture, but a conversation. His style was friendly and engaging right from the start.  

He spoke about **Guru Nanak Dev Ji** and his *4 Udasian*, and shared the core principles – *Kirat Karo, Naam Japo, Vand Shako*. He reminded us that there are many engineering colleges in Punjab, but GNE stands out because of its focus on *Vidya Veechari Tan Parupkari*, its lack of corruption, and the dedication of its professors.  

He encouraged us to simply follow the right path – and told us we had already made the right choice by joining GNE. He also shared a personal note, saying that in the past, he himself had once dreamt of studying at this college. Towards the end, he invited students to share their own feelings and experiences from the induction days so far, making the session feel even more interactive.

Next, **Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana** (Incharge – CML, SWAYAM–NPTEL Coordinator) took the stage. He gave us a brief but clear introduction to the SWAYAM and NPTEL platforms, encouraging everyone to enroll in at least one course. He explained that these are taught by IIT professors and cover a huge range of topics, allowing us to learn anything we are interested in.  

He also emphasized that we should focus on NPTEL courses since they are most relevant to our academic path. We even logged in and created our accounts during the session. On my way home later, I explored the options and chose a course called **Developing Soft Skills and Personality** – and I’m genuinely excited about it.

### Closing Session  
The last session was by **Arvind Dhingra** (Director – STEP & Incharge – TAC). He noticed that some students were getting bored, so he cut straight to the point. He told us, *“If you do something with passion, then only you succeed.”*  

He played a quick interactive game by asking if anyone knew the last letter in the English alphabet. Someone said “A”, and he playfully accepted it as correct. His short 7–8 minute talk was light, engaging, and a nice way to close the day.

## Day 7 – Induction Program

The first session of the day was conducted by **Dr. Parminder Singh** (Dean – Student Welfare).  
He spoke about the wide range of sports facilities and opportunities available in the college, highlighting how important it is to balance education with hobbies like sports. He explained that participating in sports not only improves physical fitness but also plays a major role in maintaining mental well-being.  
Dr. Singh encouraged us to keep polishing our talents alongside academics and shared the process of how to participate in different sports events organized by the college.

After his session, a member of the **Causmic Club** briefly introduced the various departmental clubs on campus. The focus was on encouraging students to get involved, explore new interests, and make the most of the opportunities these clubs provide.

The next speaker was **Dr. Amit Kamra** (Associate Professor in the IT Department & Incharge – DMC).  
He introduced the **Digital Marketing Club**, explained what digital marketing is, and shared how being part of this club could help us develop valuable skills while boosting employability. Dr. Kamra spoke about his personal journey, the challenges he faced, and how he built his team. He also showcased some of their project videos and introduced a few club members. The way he presented the field of digital marketing made it sound innovative, practical, and exciting.

The final session of the day was led by **Dr. Randhir Singh** on *“Conduct of Examination.”*  
He gave a detailed walkthrough of the **GNDEC academic portal**, explaining almost every section in a clear and structured way. The session covered essential information about the examination process, submission timelines, and tools available on the portal. This was particularly useful for understanding how to navigate our academic resources effectively.
